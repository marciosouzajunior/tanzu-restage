# Tanzu Restage

This is a Node command line application that allows to restage multiple applications deployed on Tanzu at once.

## How it works

It uses the [cf cli](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/cf-cli/install-go-cli.html) tool the package [inquirer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer) to allow the user select and restage the apps found at the Tanzu foundation, org and space.

## How to use

Install the package and run:

```
C:\>npm install -g git+https://github.com/marciosouzajunior/tanzu-restage.git
C:\>tanzu-restage
```
